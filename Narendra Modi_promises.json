            "The Strange Triumph of Narendra Modi: Can India\u2019s Prime Minister Succeed Even as the Economy Plummets?",
            "In 2014, Modi came to power on the promise of an improved economy. As of 2019, India\u2019s economic growth is slowing but Modi\u2019s popularity appears to be intact. If the BJP cannot correct the course of the economy, it will eventually impact the BJP at the polls.",

            "When India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, ran for the top job five years ago, he campaigned as the country\u2019s best hope for economic reform. The government he ran against, led by the Congress party, had mismanaged the economy, fallen into paralysis, and faced one major corruption scandal after another. Modi convinced voters that he was the answer to their economic woes. He spouted slogans like \u201cminimum government, maximum governance\u201d and promised that the \u201cgovernment has no business to be in business.\u201d On the strength of such promises, he led his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a sweeping general election victory in 2014 and followed that with a landslide reelection in 2019.",
            "The dominance of the BJP, however, has surprisingly little do with its economic track record. Modi has succeeded politically despite \u2014not because of\u2014the economy, which is in the midst of a protracted downturn that began on his watch. For his second term, the prime minister has doubled down on the grand economic promises he made in his 2014 campaign and gone still further, setting a goal of turning India into a $5 trillion economy by 2024. But his government has struggled to articulate just how it will bring about India\u2019s economic renewal. While the prime minister has yet to pay a serious political price for this failure, he cannot count on the indefinite forbearance of Indian voters.",

Indian officials said they did so to better integrate Kashmir into the rest of India. But many Kashmiris fear the constitutional change may lead to an influx of outsiders, diluting their Muslim majority in the region."

While official campaigning is still weeks away, India\u2019s two principal parties \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its archrival, the Indian National Congress \u2014 are leaving no stone unturned in their quest for votes.",
            "First came the BJP government\u2019s announcement that it would guarantee 10 percent of university seats and civil service posts for \u201ceconomically weaker sections\u201d of the populace untouched by existing affirmative action programs. Last week, the dynastic Congress party responded by announcing that Priyanka Gandhi \u2014 the latest in the line of Nehru-Gandhi heirs to take the political plunge \u2014 would play an active role in the forthcoming campaign.",
            "The timing of the announcement, which immediately set social media alight and dominated the evening news programs, is almost as interesting as the content: On Friday, the Modi government will present its final budget of its tenure before general elections. While the government was widely expected to unveil its own income support scheme for rural Indians, who have grown anxious amid low commodity prices and rising debts, it now finds itself in danger of being outmaneuvered. In politics, big is good, and bigger is better. The government must at least match what the Congress has to offer or risk losing the perceptions game.",
            "Ironically, it was the Modi government that first mooted the idea of a universal basic income in its 2017 flagship economic survey. While the government has shown no haste in carrying the idea forward, two opposition-controlled states \u2014 Telangana and Odisha \u2014 have since implemented a partial income guarantee scheme squarely aimed at lifting farmers\u2019 incomes. More recently, the ruling party in the state of Sikkim \u2014 a BJP ally \u2014 has announced it will unveil a comprehensive universal basic income by 2022.",
            "The Congress\u2019 surprise announcement is emblematic of most blue-sky campaign promises: long on promise and short on specifics.",
            "Implementing any large-scale income support program calls for two essential ingredients: state capacity and fiscal resources. Unfortunately, both are in short supply in India. The country\u2019s social service plumbing is notoriously feeble: India\u2019s welfare machinery suffers from endemic \u201cleakage\u201d (or corruption) and \u201cpoor targeting\u201d (an inability to properly identify and deliver benefits to eligible recipients). Furthermore, India\u2019s fiscal accounts are underwater. Last week, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist flagged the country\u2019s fiscal deficit as a major economic risk factor, especially in an election year prone to populist giveaways.",
            "Neither the Congress nor the BJP has grappled with the realities of implementing a universal basic income for 200 million rural households, but a proposal unveiled this week by a team led by Arvind Subramanian \u2014 the former chief economic adviser to the Modi government \u2014 provides a tantalizing blueprint for dispensing cash to India\u2019s neediest citizens while potentially circumventing the country\u2019s administrative infirmities. Subramanian, now a visiting lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, and his co-authors have called for the next Indian government to implement what they call a QUBRI, or a quasi-universal basic rural income for India.",
            "The idea is simple enough: The government would provide an annual lump sum payment to every poor rural household in India \u2014 no questions asked \u2014 as a financial safety net. The proposal suggests an annual transfer of 18,000 rupees (1,500 rupees per month) to each eligible rural household \u2014 about $250 annually.",
            "To target recipients effectively, the proposed QUBRI would exclude the richest 25 percent of households. Transfers would be sent electronically to recipient bank accounts, which are ubiquitous now even in remote areas thanks to a recent government effort to universalize banking access. The authors estimate the costs of the scheme would be around 1.3 percent of India\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 a significant chunk of which would come from eliminating a raft of regressive agricultural subsidies.",
            "This sounds wonderful in practice, but the politics are not nearly as cut and dry. For starters, if eliminating farmer subsidies were painless, the government would have done it a long time ago. Research suggests that many Indians are leery of giving up existing subsidies in favor of uncertain cash transfers.",
            "Moreover, the existing debate is exclusively focused on India\u2019s rural dwellers. But it is India\u2019s urban population that is burgeoning as migrants flock to cities in search of opportunity. The inadequacy of formal-sector jobs and the abysmal state of urban amenities suggest it is only a matter of time before urban residents demand their share of government largesse.",
            "For now, these technical details will be left to the economists and opinion writers to debate. For India\u2019s politicians, there\u2019s an election to be won. But the question remains: Will the Indian electorate really be wooed by a mere promise of easy cash? In 2014, voters were drawn to Modi like a moth to a flame, swayed by his pledge of ushering in \u201cacche din\u201d (good times) for the Indian economy, generating millions of jobs and reviving India\u2019s moribund investment cycle. Five years later, his promises remain unfulfilled and voters, for their part, have begun to expect more.",

No single party has captured the number of seats needed to form a government\u2014272\u2014on its own in thirty years, making this election particularly significant in Indian politics. Despite his controversial past, Narendra Modi will lead the new Indian government and will be expected to deliver on his campaign promises of economic growth and good governance.

A majority of the agricultural land is already organic by default, but experts speculate that a fully organic Bhutan would hurt export crop levels."

It contested the 2014 parliamentary election along with their supportive parties, to form National Democratic Alliance with Narendra Modi as its Prime Ministerial candidate and party president Rajnath Singh as the chief-of-election of campaign. The important issues during the campaign included price hikes, corruption, the economy, national security, basic infrastructure such as roads and railways, and supplying basic needs such as electricity and water.[1] The party promised a vibrant and participatory democracy, inclusive and sustainable development, quality of life, productive youth, a globally competitive economy, open and transparent government, and pro-active and pro-people governance in its manifesto.[2]",
            "In March 2013, Narendra Modi was appointed to the BJP Parliamentary Board, the party's highest decision-making body, and was chosen to be chairman of the party's Central Election Campaign Committee.[3][4] On 10 June 2013, Modi was selected to head the poll campaign for the elections at the national level executive meeting of BJP in Goa.[5][6] The party's senior leader L.K. Advani resigned from all his posts at the party following the selection. However, Advani withdrew his resignation the next day at the urging of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.[7] On 19 July 2013, a 12-member committee, headed by Modi and under the guidance of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Rajnath Singh and Advani was appointed at the Goa conclave which included Murli Manohar Joshi, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Nitin Gadkari, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Ananth Kumar, Thawar Chand Gehlot, Ram Lal, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh and Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar.[8][9][10] Further sub-committees were made headed by senior party leaders.

India is ranked 95 out of a 179 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, but its score has improved consistently from 2.7 in 2002 to 3.1 in 2011.[15] In India, corruption takes the form of bribes, tax evasion, exchange controls, embezzlement, etc. Since the last general election in 2009, the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement by Anna Hazare, and other similar moves by Baba Ramdev, have gathered momentum and political interest.[16] The anti-corruption movement activist Anna Hazare began a hunger strike at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in August 2011 with the chief legislative aim to alleviate corruption in the Indian government through introduction of the Jan Lokpal Bill. Another aim, spearheaded by Ramdev, was the repatriation of black money from Swiss and other foreign banks.",
            "Since 1991, when India undertook a series of reforms in the face of a balance-of-payments crisis, the nation has been governed by a broad agreement about its economy. Starting in 2012, India entered a period of more anaemic growth, with growth slowing down to 4.4%. Other economic problems also became apparent: a plunging Indian rupee, a persistent high current account deficit and slow industrial growth. Hit by the US Federal Reserve's decision to taper quantitative easing, foreign investors had been rapidly pulling out money from India though this has now reversed with the Stock market at near all-time high and the current account deficit narrowing substantially. Bloomberg highlighted India's slowing economy amidst a record high current account deficit and a falling rupee in summer 2013. It pointed out to a lack of infrastructure investment and a government increasingly likely to give subsidies the national finances cannot afford just before the election. Other points it mentioned were stagnant policymaking and an inefficient bureaucracy.[17][18] The economy was the main issue in the campaign.[19] The lack of a clear mandate as a result of the election could lead to an increase in the price of gold in the country.[20][21]",

            "Corruption: The BJP said that to eliminate the scope of corruption, it will emphasise on technology enabled e-Governance. Apart from that public awareness, policy-driven governance and simplification of the tax regime have also been cited as solutions to the problem of corruption.",
            "E-Governance: There was a special mention of e-governance and IT as an enabler of empowerment. The manifesto said that BJP will focus on increasing the penetration and usage of broadband across the country, leverage technology for e-Governance, generate IT based jobs in rural and semi-urban areas, use mobile and e-Banking to ensure financial inclusion.",

It said no to FDI in multi-brand retail but said that FDI will be allowed in sectors wherever needed for job and asset creation, infrastructure and acquisition of niche technology and specialised expertise. The party promised to set up a Price Stabilisation Fund to check inflation, ensure fiscal discipline and pursue banking sector reforms to deal with the problem of rising bad loans. The manifesto said that a dedicated fund will be created for integrated development of Himalayan region. BJP promised to bring all states on board to implement GST.

            "\u2018Make In India\u2019 promises manufacturing jobs for millions. Here\u2019s why it won\u2019t work",
            "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is spending this week promoting his \u201cMake In India\u201d campaign, an ambitious program designed to turn the subcontinent into a \u201cglobal manufacturing hub.\u201d Modi\u2019s vision is grand: He hopes to\u00a0create 100 million manufacturing jobs\u00a0in the next six years and spur the development of a middle class that will power the Indian economy for years to come.",
            "I worry that productivity gains arising from automation have made manufacturing-driven development an antiquated approach. It may have worked for China, but India is too late to reap the benefits of this strategy. Technology has progressed so rapidly over the past few decades that only very cheap wages can compete with capital equipment. And to be competitive with the rise of robotics, those wages must stay low \u2014 exactly the opposite of what India\u2019s economy needs.",
            "At first glance, you might not notice the problems with the Make In India strategy. Modi\u2019s plan has, after all, attracted significant foreign investment. Last summer, electronics manufacturer Foxconn\u00a0announced\u00a0plans\u00a0to invest $5 billion in a factory in western India, while GM\u00a0unveiled\u00a0$1 billion in planned investments on the subcontinent. Other companies, including\u00a0Airbus\u00a0and\u00a0Hyundai, also announced major investments in India to expand their global manufacturing footprint. Overall, foreign direct investment\u00a0increased\u00a039 percent over the last 18 months, making India the\u00a0number one destination\u00a0in the world for foreign investment.",
            "This is all great news for India. But it may not create the jobs Modi needs to achieve his goal. The outlook for the Make In India campaign is not as rosy as recent investments suggest. The country only\u00a0created\u00a04 million manufacturing jobs between 2010 and 2014. At that rate of growth, the sector would only produce 8 million more jobs by 2022 \u2014 far below Modi\u2019s target of 100 million.",
            "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks during the inauguration ceremony of the \u2018Make In India\u2019 week in Mumbai, India, Feb. 13, 2016. Photo byDanish Siddiqui/Reuters",
            "A likely culprit for this probable shortfall was embodied by one of Prime Minister Modi\u2019s distinguished guests at this week\u2019s promotional events. It was not the CEO of a powerful multinational, the prime minister of a major European country or even an accomplished development economist. It was a robot.",
            "Even Foxconn, a company that uses more than 1 million employees to assemble Apple products,\u00a0plans to automate\u00a070 percent of its assembly line work over the next three years.\u00a0The future of global manufacturing is clear: more robots, fewer workers. And this means a huge pool of low-cost labor is no longer a competitive advantage in development. Manufacturing may never again be the job-creation engine it once was.",
            "If manufacturing cannot create the much-needed jobs, it\u2019s hard to imagine how the Make In India campaign will generate the broad-based, sustainable growth the country seeks. Even if India becomes a global production hub, the declining labor intensity of manufacturing suggests the rewards from this accomplishment will be highly concentrated among very few. The economic tide may rise, but not everyone will have a boat.",
            "The extreme automation represented by YuMi may seem new, but the dynamic of diminishing returns to industrialization has been in place for decades. Researchers have\u00a0noted that\u00a0the share of manufacturing jobs in industrializing economies has been consistently peaking at lower-income levels. In America, manufacturing employment\u00a0peaked\u00a0when per capita income was at $17,700; decades later, South Korean\u2019s manufacturing employment peaked around $12,700; and in Brazil, it peaked around $8,700. More recently, some African countries have seen manufacturing employment peak with income levels around $2,000 per capita. As the\u00a0Economist bluntly\u00a0concluded, \u201cThe technological transformation now under way appears to be permanently changing the economics of development\u2026China may be among the last economies to be able to ride industrialisation to middle-income status.\u201d",
            "It\u2019s hard to imagine that anyone \u2014 in India or elsewhere \u2014 will succeed at putting the productivity genie back in the bottle. But focusing on what worked in China is a recipe for disappointment. It\u2019s time to rethink the Make In India campaign, and it\u2019s best to do so soon. Without a new strategy, Modi\u2019s manufacturing mantra may mean malaise for millions. And worse,\u00a0it may mean India\u00a0never\u00a0emerges as a developed nation.",

            "The biggest election year in history has already led to significant political shifts around the world, underscoring the resilience of democratic systems. But to minimize the risk of political backsliding, newly elected reformist leaders must deliver on their promises to fight corruption and improve living standards.",
            "The 2024 election cycle has already led to significant political shifts. In Poland, record turnout among women and young voters in last year\u2019s general election handed a victory to a united coalition of pro-democracy parties, which also won the European elections in June. The same month, India\u2019s general election resulted in another win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, but the BJP lost its parliamentary majority, owing to regional movements and social-justice campaigns that enabled opposition parties to make significant gains. And in Senegal, mass protests forced former President Macky Sall to abandon his efforts to extend his term by postponing the election. Just weeks later, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, a former tax inspector running on an anti-corruption platform, won decisively.",
            "While the challenges ahead may seem daunting, these victories offer glimmers of hope, underscoring the resilience of democratic systems. But as the world shifts from the electoral frenzy of 2024 to the practical realities of governing, newly elected reformist leaders will face the difficult task of making good on their campaign promises.",
            "This is no easy feat, even in well-established democracies. Countries emerging from autocratic rule face even greater challenges, as new governments must dismantle entrenched networks of former regime loyalists who may act as spoilers and try to block any reform that threatens their interests.",
            "First, to prevent democratic backsliding, newly elected reformers must strengthen core democratic institutions like the legislature, the judiciary, and independent government agencies. Above all, they need to protect these bodies from the influence of illiberal forces, both foreign and domestic.",
            "In extreme cases, sweeping reforms are necessary to root out entrenched corruption and restore integrity to public administration. Ukraine\u2019s 2014 Revolution of Dignity is a prime example. After ousting Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s kleptocratic regime, the new government \u2013 in cooperation with civil-society groups \u2013 initiated a series of anti-corruption measures. These included vetting the judiciary, strengthening accountability mechanisms, and introducing transparency tools like open-access databases to enable ordinary citizens to track corporate ownership structures and the allocation of state resources.",
            "Fourth, debt distress can severely impede a new government\u2019s ability to implement essential economic and social programs. When Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema took office in 2021, he discovered that his predecessors had taken on enormous, undisclosed loans, especially from China. Zambia\u2019s crushing debt burden has forced the government to spend more on servicing loans than it does on health, education, and sanitation combined. Meanwhile, the process of restructuring these debts has dragged on for more than three years.",
            "Amid economic and geopolitical turmoil, the stakes could not be higher. Newly elected reformist leaders must deliver on their promises to improve living standards while protecting democracy. Failure risks pushing voters toward populist leaders and exposing their countries to domestic or foreign manipulation. But if they succeed, the coming \u201cyear of governance\u201d could be a turning point, ushering in an era of democratic renewal.",

            "With India headed to elections this April, the ruling BJP is rolling out enormous publicity campaigns to promote its record on economic growth and Hindu nationalism. Central to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s third bid for reelection is the narrative that the Indian economy continues to grow and remains open for business. Amid the ample flows of international finance, and support from Western capitals, Modi\u2019s India is an increasingly ethno-nationalist state. This week, tens of millions of Hindus mobilized across the country as Modi inaugurated a Ram temple in Ayodhya, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Built at the site of a Muslim mosque destroyed by Hindu extremists in 1992, the temple\u2019s unveiling represents a major step in Hindu nationalism\u2014and the symbolic end of India\u2019s secular republic. The question as to whether Modi\u2019s Hindutva agenda lies in contradiction with the economic liberalism that has defined much of BJP\u2019s policy is on many commentators\u2019 lips.",
            "The BJP has long relied on a well-oiled marketing machine to win votes. The advertising blitz now underway recalls the party\u2019s \u201cIndia Shining\u201d campaign of 2004, launched by the Ministry of Finance. Then, as now, images were plastered across the country, expressing optimism about the country\u2019s economic performance and promoting liberal reforms. At the 2014 elections, Modi ran with the slogan of\u00a0 \u201cgood times,\u201d promising development, a \u201cmuscular Hindu nation,\u201d and a bright and glorious future.",
            "To discuss these ad campaigns and the connections between the seemingly separate spheres of economic growth, national identity, and international politics, we talked to the Indian historian of nationalism, Ravinder Kaur. She is the associate professor of Modern South Asian studies at the University of Copenhagen, and the author of 4 books, including Brand New Nation: Capitalist Dreams and Nationalist Designs in 21st Century India, The People of India, Identity, Inequity and Inequality in India and China, and\u00a0Since 1947: Partition Narratives among Punjabi Migrants of Delhi.",
            "Ravinder kaur: I begin my book in the 1990s, arguing that the last three decades of economic reforms basically transformed the nation into a commodity. I traced the ways in which India, the post colony, turned itself into an \u201cemerging market.\u201d Contrary to the understanding of globalization as a process imposed from the outside and resisted by local groups, I argue that economic \u201cLPG\u201d reforms\u2014liberalization, privatization, globalization\u2014were embraced by the policy elite in India. Initially, there was some political pushback against it, both within the BJP and Congress, but by the turn of the century, any resistance to them had disappeared.",
            "In the early 2000s, the government organized and funded mass publicity campaigns, such as \u201cIncredible India\u201d and \u201cIndia Shining.\u201d These were used to try to brand postcolonial India as a lucrative investment destination for global capital. These campaign ads showcased India as\u00a0 Hindu, rather than the multiethnic society that it is. The Brand India publicity material mostly appeared as a repackaging of cultural symbols\u2014from yoga to Ayurveda, colorful festivals to nature, and a virtual absence of Muslims. These campaigns dovetailed with a broader cultural politics that sought to define who was included and who was excluded in India.",
            "RK: The infusion of capital promises progress and prosperity, and is a sign of the nation\u2019s arrival on the world stage. Capital appears as a curative force that can efface the shame of colonial subjugation and violence, and redeem the nation\u2019s lost glory via economic growth.",
            "Identity economy entails reimagining the nation as a commercial enclosure that can be put at the disposal of investors\u2014its territory as a vast reservoir of untapped natural resources, its population as a \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d that provides both labor and consumer markets to sustain growth, and its cultural essence to be turned into a corporate brand identity. Thus, the emergent nation form\u2014the brand new nation\u2014is erected not just upon the scaffolding of economic growth, but also the promise of civilizational glory and rejuvenation.",
            "TS: Could you specify the link between liberalizing policy changes to attract foreign capital and India\u2019s domestic politics?",
            "RK: One goal of these ad campaigns is to signal to the world that we are open for business. They seek to invite investment, both domestic and foreign. In India, much of the liberalization of the economy has taken place in the service sector, and the country\u2019s service exports have boomed. There has also been an attempt to boost and open the manufacturing sector\u2014as with the flagship program called \u201cMake In India\u201d\u2014and turn the entire territory into a zone of production, with mixed results. Meanwhile, the vast agricultural sector\u2014India remains a country where 46 percent of working age adults are engaged in farming\u2014has been the last area to remain protected. When in 2020 the BJP made attempts to liberalize and deregulate farming, large-scale farmers\u2019 protests broke out and forced the government to shelve its reforms.",
            "Liberalization has not happened suddenly, as shock therapy, but gradually. There are regulatory requirements for Indian partnerships or joint ventures, rather than 100 percent foreign ownership. These projects lead to a lot of conflicts, as making land\u2014especially farmland\u2014available to investors is often fraught, and Modi\u2019s land liberalization agenda too has stalled.",
            "Likewise, modes of federal governance have changed a lot. India competes for foreign\u00a0 investments but, within India, different regions also compete with each other to lay claim to those investments. The current government has sought to create what\u2019s known as the \u201cone nation\u201d model\u2014one nation, one tax, one market. This entails greater centralization of economic and political power in Delhi and the weakening of the regional power structures. This has been attempted, for example, through a common Goods and Services tax system that centralizes revenue collection, thus giving greater power to the central government. That too is a project to unify the entire territory, both in an economic and cultural sense.",
            "RK: These policy initiatives have always been led by the elite; to think that they have ever had a grassroots constituency is a mistake. Only after the policies are made by the elite does the question of selling it to the population come up. This is where mass campaigns or political spectacle have become a central component of Indian politics.",
            "What I analyze in the book is how these mass publicity campaigns emerged as a form of governance. In the run up to the 2004 election, BJP prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpeyi launched the \u201cIndia Shining\u201d campaign, which celebrated the high growth rates the country was reaping while encouraging higher consumption among newly affluent Indians. When the BJP then lost the 2004 election, many blamed the \u201cIndia Shining\u201d campaign. What people forget is that though the government lost the election, its liberal economic reform program had already become hegemonic. The Congress Party\u2019s counter slogan to the BJP\u2019s \u201cIndia Shining\u201d was \u201cAam Aadmi ko kya mila\u201d (\u201cWhat did the common person gain out of it?\u201d). The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government (2004\u20132014) also wanted to deliver \u201creforms with a human face.\u201d",
            "TS: When Modi came to power in 2014 his election campaign promised acche din: India Shining 2.0. Despite the optimism from many corners, India\u2019s economy has underperformed since then. Growth rates have fallen, underemployment remains high, investors have been burnt, and inequality is skyrocketing. How has Modi\u2019s government responded to all this? Is it concerned about inequality or is it totally committed to an oligarchic project with the Adani and Ambani families at the core?",
            "At the same time, the Modi government has kept in place many of the welfarist policies established by the UPA. For example, it maintained the Right to Work (National Rural Employment Guarantee) schemes, which guaranteed 100 days of work to 64 million rural workers, especially women. It also preserved the Right to Food program. Likewise, the BJP increased social welfare goods. The most prominent successes have been targeted poverty alleviation programs: the distribution of cooking gas cylinders, widening access to bank accounts, and direct cash transfers. So it\u2019s not the case that Modi simply embraced a free-market model, which would have had its own major obstacles in a country the size of India.",
            "A key difference between the UPA and the current government is how welfare is administered. Rather than a basic provision from the state, welfare provisions are marketed and advertised as a benevolent gift from the BJP government, indeed as the beneficence of Modi himself. This is not welfare as a citizen\u2019s right but as a gift one should be grateful for. These branding exercises have reaped electoral benefits for the BJP, especially among rural women in\u00a0 Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.",
            "RK: India\u2019s efforts to brand itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest democracy\u201d helped project it as an alternative to an authoritarian China\u2014whence the paradox: under Modi, the very democratic advantage that shaped Brand India\u2019s image on the world stage entailed its steady erosion at home. Hindutva politics recognises this contradiction: it cashes in on India\u2019s democratic credentials to gain external recognition even as it weakens democratic institutions at home. Consider the unabashed implementation of the hardline Hindutva agenda in Modi\u2019s second term\u2014from the revocation of the special status of Kashmir in August 2019, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that excluded Muslims, to the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya this week. What characterizes this moment of majoritarian muscle flexing is the heavy-handed suppression of dissent (the crux of democracy), especially in university spaces, and how the act of protest itself has been criminalized by the State.",
            "TS: What do you make of Modi\u2019s India positioning the country as a pro-West bulwark against China? This project seems like it would be a momentous shift away from India\u2019s long-held foreign policy of nonalignment.",
            "The old Indian project of pan-Asian unity is long gone. Nehru was very much invested in that, but it came undone thanks to the Indo-China War in 1962. The ongoing border conflict between India and China has caused immense nationalist mobilization on both sides. So regardless of which party is in power, given the security threat China poses to India, any government would be pro-Western.",
            "TS: Modi has also positioned India as a champion of the Global South. He has argued that India faces massive challenges and wants reform of the unequal Westen-led international order\u2014just like developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. At last year\u2019s G20, India championed the goals of debt relief, poverty reduction, and sustainable development.

            "Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledges to make India a developed country in 25 years",
            "NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to\u00a0raise millions out of poverty\u00a0and turn India into a developed country in the next quarter-century as he marked 75 years since independence from British rule.",
            "Modi said millions of people across the country were commemorating the 75th anniversary of independence by hoisting national flags at their homes and businesses for three days as part of a government campaign \u201cof awakening the spirit of patriotism in every heart.\u201d India\u2019s Parliament, the presidential palace, national monuments and other government offices blazed with multi-colored lighting.",
            "The main opposition Congress party accused the Modi government of leaving opposition parties out of the celebrations.",
            "In his 80-minute speech, Modi made no reference to\u00a0India\u2019s tense ties with immediate neighbors Pakistan\u00a0and China, or any steps to improve relations.",
            "He called for unity to move forward but didn\u2019t respond to experts and critics who say the country has been gradually departing from some commitments and argue the backsliding has accelerated since Modi came to power in 2014. They accuse his populist government of using unbridled political power to\u00a0undermine democratic freedoms\u00a0and preoccupying itself with pursuing a\u00a0Hindu nationalist agenda.",
            "Modi pledged to fight political corruption and nepotism, which he said were acting as termites eating away the gains of development.",

            "Five more years, with a twist. India\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost ground in this year\u2019s elections, according to early results announced Tuesday, meaning Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on track to lead a coalition government after winning a historic third consecutive term. The world\u2019s largest democratic exercise\u2014more than six hundred million people voted over six weeks\u2014surprised pollsters and pundits, as opposition parties gained seats in parliament. What can we expect from a Modi-led coalition\u2014the first time he has ever had to manage a political coalition? What was behind the electoral shifts? We turned to our India experts for the answers.",
            "Kapil Sharma: A Modi-led coalition government is good news for India\u2019s economic growth",
            "Seema Sirohi: The BJP came into the election overconfident. It leaves humbled.",
            "Sh\u00e9k Jain: Expect Modi to keep pushing back against the West on climate policy, while making changes at the local level",
            "Atman Trivedi: A surprising election verdict puts the BJP on notice",
            "The Indian electorate handed Modi and the BJP a historic third consecutive five-year term. After an election supported by more than 642 million voters, 312 million of whom were women, Modi, the BJP, and their coalition members have secured a mandate to continue their ambitious political and economic agenda\u2014albeit with a bit more political maneuvering and a much stronger opposition.",
            "Modi\u2019s win was not a surprise, although it was not expected to be under a coalition government. Still, he is prepared to hit the ground running. Modi\u2019s agenda will likely be executed by a new and younger coalition cabinet, though the exact portfolios and officials are yet to be announced. Even under a coalition government, this is good news for India\u2019s economic growth and business environment. The agenda will continue to include reforms for industrial manufacturing, infrastructure, digitization, regional trade, supply chain agreements, and even land reform\u2014with a coalition government even more likely to emphasize economics. While the Indian equities markets have not reacted favorably to the news of a coalition government, businesses will welcome continued certainty. But as the results have shown, the voters need to feel the success of these policies on the ground with jobs and economic growth.",
            "The BJP has many challenges going forward. The party\u2019s popularity rides on Modi\u2014he polls twice as popular as the BJP as a party and drives a third of its votes. Looking to the future, Modi is seventy-three years old and does not have a clear successor. This is likely his last national election. His popularity and a weaker national opposition party have allowed the BJP to paper over its weaknesses\u2014especially at the state and local levels.",
            "At this stage, there are three big takeaways from this election: 1) Democracy is alive and well in India; 2) Indians want jobs, jobs, and jobs; and 3) the Indian voter will hold the government to growing the economy over religion. On the third point, it\u2019s worth noting that the BJP is losing in Ayodhya, the site of the Ram Mandir, a temple the BJP fulfilled a campaign promise to build to replace a sixteenth-century Mughal-era mosque razed by Hindu groups in 1992. The site is considered to be one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest sites and has been the center of Indian politics for decades.",
            "The BJP struggled to translate its economic policies and benefits to the average voter. Coupled with a stronger anti-incumbency mood and operating under a coalition government, the BJP will need to work hard to maintain its position as India\u2019s largest party. The BJP and its coalition government are now operating in a \u201cnow or never\u201d moment.",
            "The opposition Congress party under Rahul Gandhi has made a spirited comeback with a campaign that emphasized economic issues over religious divides. Gandhi\u2019s two yatras, or journeys, through huge parts of India listening to people and learning about their problems seemed to have resonated with voters. The performance is all the more significant given the uneven playing field\u2014the Modi government is accused of using various ploys to hobble the opposition.",
            "Shrunken and humbled, the BJP will still be able to form a government with Modi as prime minister for the third time, but the party\u2019s allies will extract a bigger price for coming along.",
            "Heading into his third term as prime minister, this election was marred for Modi by the unrealistic expectations that he set for himself\u2014a target of four hundred parliamentary seats for the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). NDA\u2019s numbers have been diminished, as some parties have left the alliance\u2014including Shiromani Akali Dal, which could have helped the NDA in Punjab, and the Shiv Sena, which could have added eleven more members of parliament (MPs).",
            "This election has seen a close contest in Uttar Pradesh, a state that sends eighty MPs to the parliament. It witnessed the consolidation of minority voters and support for affirmative action, based on the opposition INDIA coalition\u2019s narrative that the ruling NDA would change the constitution and end the reservation system, under which historically disadvantaged castes and communities receive quota-based jobs and educational opportunities.",
            "The election also saw candidates intelligently align themselves in key constituencies, where the Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress avoided direct clashes and made the BJP/NDA candidates sweat, especially in the eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh belt of Jats, which had substantial opposition to the NDA and BJP because of the controversial farm law proposals.",
            "The BJP is still the single largest political party in the parliament, and the NDA coalition will return to power, as it has comfortably crossed the required majority of 272 seats in parliament. But Modi\u2019s administration will be weakened by the pressures of running a coalition government and catering to demands based on regional mandates, which makes bold economic or political decisions long in the making. This may impact policy formulation and the financial investments by big corporations as well as the stock market, in the near term.",
            "Modi may not be seriously impacted by the election results, nor is his image in the international arena likely to suffer. He will still be the prime minister and thus represent the government and India in international fora, but he will need to tread with caution to keep his coalition together.",
            "Voters seem satisfied with Modi\u2019s efforts to elevate India on the global stage and with many of his policies for national economic growth. Viewed from the lens of climate change, the electorate appears content with Modi\u2019s performance at the COP26 climate change summit in 2021\u2014where Modi committed to reducing India\u2019s carbon emissions to net-zero by 2070\u2014and as president of the Group of Twenty (G20) last year. Constituents largely agree with Modi\u2019s position that India needs balance in solving climate change and deserves an opportunity to develop like Western nations. I expect to see Modi double down on this position and work with the developing nations grouping known as the BRICS to deflate pressure from the West. Modi will flex more on global climate change, arguing that sustainability encompasses poverty alleviation and economic opportunity as much as environmental stewardship.",
            "But Modi cannot ignore the fact that his party lost ground in this election. Modi\u2019s support as a strongman facing the rest of the world may be intact, but the BJP\u2019s strong-arm approach domestically seems to have made the electorate wary. The climate corollary is that, while India\u2019s international stance on climate change is popular, the BJP\u2019s approach at the local level has been less effective (notwithstanding the borderless nature of most pollution). Constituents do not seem to be able to connect the dots on how BJP climate policies benefit them. The air is still polluted, clean water remains scarce, heat is reaching unlivable levels, and climate catastrophes keep occurring. To shore up his party, Modi likely will start connecting these dots by promoting new, farmer-friendly alternatives to burning crop residues, doing more on water recycling and floodwater detention/retention, and making lower-carbon cooking fuels more accessible. Look for new programs, or revamping of existing programs, in these areas.",
            "To understand the complexity, consider just one state, Maharashtra. Maharashtra\u2019s politics since the state\u2019s formation in 1960 have been eccentric and eclectic to say the least\u2014with only one chief minister (the equivalent of a governor in the United States) having completed a full five-year term. Four major parties ran in Maharashtra in the 2019 elections. Over the years, two of these parties split, resulting in different factions of them being simultaneously in government and opposition. As the results come in, the BJP and the Congress party are leading in Maharashtra, but in third and fourth place are the surviving factions of the broken parties running against the BJP. In Maharashtra and several other states, factionalism worked to secure power for the BJP by bringing together diametrically opposed right-wing and left-wing parties, but this method has not received validation from the Indian voters in Maharashtra as the results of this election cycle show.",
            "Maharashtra is only one example, and political factionalism is only one topic that has trended in India in the last five years. The results show that Indian citizens have paid attention to the regional issues affecting tens and hundreds of millions\u2014political factionalism, women\u2019s rights, employment, government employment in all sectors including the military, communal strife, controversial legislation, caste discrimination, and regional discrimination.",
            "India\u2019s election results held a surprise that very few expected. Modi is expected to become the prime minister for a third consecutive term, unless there are any last-minute surprises or changes in coalitions, which cannot be ruled out\u2014stranger things have happened in Indian democracy. Yet, this victory should feel like a setback for Modi. He gave a clarion call for his coalition to get four hundred seats. However, his coalition is struggling to gain even three hundred seats and his party is falling short of an absolute majority. The BJP has won, but it\u2019s a victory of a different kind. The Congress party is celebrating, despite winning only around one hundred seats in the parliament. But for them, it\u2019s a defeat that must feel like a victory, since they performed much better than expected.",
            "However, the key takeaway from this election is that India\u2019s democracy is alive and kicking. It is a myth that the Indian economy and polity thrives under especially strong majority governments. Some of India\u2019s biggest economic reforms happened under the coalition governments of the 1990s and 2000s. This result, in which the BJP will need to form a coalition to govern, should give us hope.",
            "India has a parliamentary form of government, which some say was slowly turning into a \u201cprime ministerial\u201d form of government (with power concentrated in the executive). These election results will give back some of the power to the legislature.",
            "We can expect India\u2019s parliament and parliamentary committees to become more active, with more bills being debated and deliberated. This is also a vote that shows that the Indian electorate does not cast its votes based on singular issues. Regional issues cannot be neglected, every vote needs to be earned, and overconfidence can be lethal. The best politics is building an economy that works for everyone\u2014these elections have reminded us of this fact. The country will see policy continuity, but with checks. India will have the strongest opposition it has had in the past ten years, but a decisive leader still at the top.",
            "Both sides may claim victory based on these surprising election results. But India\u2019s democracy has been the biggest winner in these elections. And that is the best outcome we may have asked for.",
            "The election results are a surprise given the predictions going into the vote count. The results reinforce the difficulty of gathering such polling data around the world. Exit polls and media reports from across the country had set the expectation of a massive win\u2014and perhaps even an absolute majority\u2014for Modi and his ruling BJP.",
            "The BJP did win, but by a significantly smaller margin than many predicted. Instead of looking at an absolute-majority rule, the BJP appears headed for a return to coalition politics. This surprise creates political and policy uncertainties that will have at least short-term consequences. A reversal of the sort of investments and capital expenditure that the government has advanced in recent years, in favor of a return to subsidies, protectionism, and welfare programs, is unlikely. But uncertainty has been introduced into the picture. Policy and political decisions will likely be delayed. Industry, particularly multinational corporations, and partner governments may hold off on some decisions as they wait and see how the new government develops.",
            "Among the sectors least affected could be the technology sector, particularly software and services. This is because the ruling parties, throughout the past several decades, have all seen the tech sector as a growth engine for the economy, exports, and jobs. In contrast, infrastructure, agriculture, and large banks are among those that face questions about the shape and impact of potential policy changes.",
            "Listening to the speakers at a recent business conference in India, as I did recently, one would never have predicted the election results announced today in India. Business and government leaders spoke about export-driven growth, artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, and ambitious visions for India over the next twenty-five years. But every so often, election results prove that voters are not necessarily as monolithic or unsophisticated as elites may think them to be. Clearly, it was what the chief executive officers and ministers did not speak of\u2014income inequality, local development, and the fabric of society\u2014that was on the minds of voters.",
            "But, as the US politician Tip O\u2019Neill famously said, \u201call politics is local.\u201d Despite strong overall economic growth, the real numbers are more complex. After subsidy adjustments, the growth rate is really closer to 6 percent. Growth remains concentrated in the south and west. Pollution and extreme heat are unbearable for large portions of the year in Delhi. And India still has nearly two hundred million people living below the global poverty line of $1.25 a day.",
            "This wasn\u2019t a Hindutva election. It was not an embrace or rejection of the BJP\u2019s majoritarian agenda. Instead, it was the type of pushback that voters around the world often provide when politicians and business leaders lose sight of the important issues in front of them.",
            "The party is still on track to remain by far the largest in the lower house, but its results fall well short of expectations. Nevertheless, voters seem comfortable with Modi and much of his agenda\u2014the BJP\u2019s vote share may prove to be comparable to 2019. Indians also appear keen to voice their concerns over economic distress and rising inequality.",
            "Under Modi\u2019s reign, the country has begun to witness robust economic growth after uneven progress during the pandemic. The economy grew at 8.2 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, and the International Monetary Fund forecasts that it will grow by 6.8 percent in 2024 and 6.5 percent in 2025. India\u2019s hard and digital infrastructure has improved, as well.",
            "The problem is most Indians have not adequately participated in the fruits of an economy with gaudy headline numbers. Growth is unequal, and jobs are few and far between. Unemployment was the top concern for 27 percent of respondents in a recent poll. Against this backdrop, it\u2019s not difficult to understand why both domestic consumption and investment are tepid.",
            "The surprising partial results begin to puncture Modi\u2019s aura of invincibility, chip away at the BJP\u2019s dominance, and breathe new life into Congress. The BJP still casts a large shadow over Indian politics, but it lacks a policy mandate.",
            "Despite the skittish reaction from equity markets, a governing coalition could lead to a sustained period of strong economic growth, like in the 1990s and 2000s. Additional consultation, while perhaps slowing reforms, promises to strengthen the health of India\u2019s democracy.",
