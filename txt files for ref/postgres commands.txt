No, you should not remove any tables. Your database looks correct! Hereâ€™s what each item means:

Name	Type	Purpose
users	Table	Stores user locations (IP, country, city, etc.).
officials	Table	Stores government officials tied to users.
users_id_seq	Sequence	Automatically increments id in users.
officials_id_seq	Sequence	Automatically increments id in officials.
Should You Remove officials_id_seq and users_id_seq?
ðŸš« No! These sequences are required for PostgreSQL to auto-increment IDs in the users and officials tables.





Explanation of Each Database
Database Name	Purpose
postgres	Default database (always exists, used for administrative tasks).
template0	A read-only system template for creating new databases.
template1	The default template used when you create a new database (political_engagement was created from this).
political_engagement	Your actual project database where all data is stored.
Should You Delete template0 and template1?
ðŸš« No! PostgreSQL needs these templates to create new databases. If you delete them, it could cause issues when creating new databases in the future.

Should You Delete postgres?
ðŸš« No!
The postgres database is the default administrative database. It's best to leave it as is, even if you donâ€™t use it.
