        "Corruption is widespread in India. India is ranked 95 out of a 179 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, but its score has improved consistently from 2.7 in 2002 to 3.1 in 2011.[15] In India, corruption takes the form of bribes, tax evasion, exchange controls, embezzlement, etc. Since the last general election in 2009, the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement by Anna Hazare, and other similar moves by Baba Ramdev, have gathered momentum and political interest.[16] The anti-corruption movement activist Anna Hazare began a hunger strike at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in August 2011 with the chief legislative aim to alleviate corruption in the Indian government through introduction of the Jan Lokpal Bill. Another aim, spearheaded by Ramdev, was the repatriation of black money from Swiss and other foreign banks.": [

        "Since 1991, when India undertook a series of reforms in the face of a balance-of-payments crisis, the nation has been governed by a broad agreement about its economy. Starting in 2012, India entered a period of more anaemic growth, with growth slowing down to 4.4%. Other economic problems also became apparent: a plunging Indian rupee, a persistent high current account deficit and slow industrial growth. Hit by the US Federal Reserve's decision to taper quantitative easing, foreign investors had been rapidly pulling out money from India though this has now reversed with the Stock market at near all-time high and the current account deficit narrowing substantially. Bloomberg highlighted India's slowing economy amidst a record high current account deficit and a falling rupee in summer 2013. It pointed out to a lack of infrastructure investment and a government increasingly likely to give subsidies the national finances cannot afford just before the election. Other points it mentioned were stagnant policymaking and an inefficient bureaucracy.[17][18] The economy was the main issue in the campaign.[19] The lack of a clear mandate as a result of the election could lead to an increase in the price of gold in the country.[20][21]": [

Amid the ample flows of international finance, and support from Western capitals, Modi\u2019s India is an increasingly ethno-nationalist state. This week, tens of millions of Hindus mobilized across the country as Modi inaugurated a Ram temple in Ayodhya, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Built at the site of a Muslim mosque destroyed by Hindu extremists in 1992, the temple\u2019s unveiling represents a major step in Hindu nationalism\u2014and the symbolic end of India\u2019s secular republic.

This entails greater centralization of economic and political power in Delhi and the weakening of the regional power structures. This has been attempted, for example, through a common Goods and Services tax system that centralizes revenue collection, thus giving greater power to the central government.

In the run up to the 2004 election, BJP prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpeyi launched the \u201cIndia Shining\u201d campaign, which celebrated the high growth rates the country was reaping while encouraging higher consumption among newly affluent Indians. When the BJP then lost the 2004 election, many blamed the \u201cIndia Shining\u201d campaign. What people forget is that though the government lost the election, its liberal economic reform program had already become hegemonic. The Congress Party\u2019s counter slogan to the BJP\u2019s \u201cIndia Shining\u201d was \u201cAam Aadmi ko kya mila\u201d (\u201cWhat did the common person gain out of it?\u201d).

Modi\u2019s agenda will likely be executed by a new and younger coalition cabinet, though the exact portfolios and officials are yet to be announced. Even under a coalition government, this is good news for India\u2019s economic growth and business environment. The agenda will continue to include reforms for industrial manufacturing, infrastructure, digitization, regional trade, supply chain agreements, and even land reform\u2014with a coalition government even more likely to emphasize economics. While the Indian equities markets have not reacted favorably to the news of a coalition government, businesses will welcome continued certainty. But as the results have shown, the voters need to feel the success of these policies on the ground with jobs and economic growth.": [],
        "At this stage, there are three big takeaways from this election: 1) Democracy is alive and well in India; 2) Indians want jobs, jobs, and jobs; and 3) the Indian voter will hold the government to growing the economy over religion. On the third point, it\u2019s worth noting that the BJP is losing in Ayodhya, the site of the Ram Mandir, a temple the BJP fulfilled a campaign promise to build to replace a sixteenth-century Mughal-era mosque razed by Hindu groups in 1992. The site is considered to be one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest sites and has been the center of Indian politics for decades.": [],
        "The BJP struggled to translate its economic policies and benefits to the average voter.

The performance is all the more significant given the uneven playing field\u2014the Modi government is accused of using various ploys to hobble the opposition.": [],
        "Shrunken and humbled, the BJP will still be able to form a government with Modi as prime minister for the third time, but the party\u2019s allies will extract a bigger price for coming along.": [],
        "The BJP is still the single largest political party in the parliament, and the NDA coalition will return to power, as it has comfortably crossed the required majority of 272 seats in parliament. But Modi\u2019s administration will be weakened by the pressures of running a coalition government and catering to demands based on regional mandates, which makes bold economic or political decisions long in the making. This may impact policy formulation and the financial investments by big corporations as well as the stock market, in the near term.": [],
        "Modi may not be seriously impacted by the election results, nor is his image in the international arena likely to suffer. He will still be the prime minister and thus represent the government and India in international fora, but he will need to tread with caution to keep his coalition together.": [],
        "To understand the complexity, consider just one state, Maharashtra. Maharashtra\u2019s politics since the state\u2019s formation in 1960 have been eccentric and eclectic to say the least\u2014with only one chief minister (the equivalent of a governor in the United States) having completed a full five-year term. Four major parties ran in Maharashtra in the 2019 elections. Over the years, two of these parties split, resulting in different factions of them being simultaneously in government and opposition. As the results come in, the BJP and the Congress party are leading in Maharashtra, but in third and fourth place are the surviving factions of the broken parties running against the BJP. In Maharashtra and several other states, factionalism worked to secure power for the BJP by bringing together diametrically opposed right-wing and left-wing parties, but this method has not received validation from the Indian voters in Maharashtra as the results of this election cycle show.": [],
        "Maharashtra is only one example, and political factionalism is only one topic that has trended in India in the last five years. The results show that Indian citizens have paid attention to the regional issues affecting tens and hundreds of millions\u2014political factionalism, women\u2019s rights, employment, government employment in all sectors including the military, communal strife, controversial legislation, caste discrimination, and regional discrimination.": [],
        "India\u2019s election results held a surprise that very few expected. Modi is expected to become the prime minister for a third consecutive term, unless there are any last-minute surprises or changes in coalitions, which cannot be ruled out\u2014stranger things have happened in Indian democracy. Yet, this victory should feel like a setback for Modi. He gave a clarion call for his coalition to get four hundred seats. However, his coalition is struggling to gain even three hundred seats and his party is falling short of an absolute majority. The BJP has won, but it\u2019s a victory of a different kind. The Congress party is celebrating, despite winning only around one hundred seats in the parliament. But for them, it\u2019s a defeat that must feel like a victory, since they performed much better than expected.": [],
        "However, the key takeaway from this election is that India\u2019s democracy is alive and kicking. It is a myth that the Indian economy and polity thrives under especially strong majority governments. Some of India\u2019s biggest economic reforms happened under the coalition governments of the 1990s and 2000s. This result, in which the BJP will need to form a coalition to govern, should give us hope.": [],
        "We can expect India\u2019s parliament and parliamentary committees to become more active, with more bills being debated and deliberated. This is also a vote that shows that the Indian electorate does not cast its votes based on singular issues. Regional issues cannot be neglected, every vote needs to be earned, and overconfidence can be lethal. The best politics is building an economy that works for everyone\u2014these elections have reminded us of this fact. The country will see policy continuity, but with checks. India will have the strongest opposition it has had in the past ten years, but a decisive leader still at the top.": [

        "The BJP did win, but by a significantly smaller margin than many predicted. Instead of looking at an absolute-majority rule, the BJP appears headed for a return to coalition politics. This surprise creates political and policy uncertainties that will have at least short-term consequences. A reversal of the sort of investments and capital expenditure that the government has advanced in recent years, in favor of a return to subsidies, protectionism, and welfare programs, is unlikely. But uncertainty has been introduced into the picture. Policy and political decisions will likely be delayed. Industry, particularly multinational corporations, and partner governments may hold off on some decisions as they wait and see how the new government develops.": [],

Business and government leaders spoke about export-driven growth, artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, and ambitious visions for India over the next twenty-five years. But every so often, election results prove that voters are not necessarily as monolithic or unsophisticated as elites may think them to be. Clearly, it was what the chief executive officers and ministers did not speak of\u2014income inequality, local development, and the fabric of society\u2014that was on the minds of voters.": [],

After subsidy adjustments, the growth rate is really closer to 6 percent. Growth remains concentrated in the south and west. Pollution and extreme heat are unbearable for large portions of the year in Delhi. And India still has nearly two hundred million people living below the global poverty line of $1.25 a day.": [],
        "The party is still on track to remain by far the largest in the lower house, but its results fall well short of expectations. Nevertheless, voters seem comfortable with Modi and much of his agenda\u2014the BJP\u2019s vote share may prove to be comparable to 2019. Indians also appear keen to voice their concerns over economic distress and rising inequality.": [],
        "Under Modi\u2019s reign, the country has begun to witness robust economic growth after uneven progress during the pandemic. The economy grew at 8.2 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, and the International Monetary Fund forecasts that it will grow by 6.8 percent in 2024 and 6.5 percent in 2025. India\u2019s hard and digital infrastructure has improved, as well.": [],
        "The problem is most Indians have not adequately participated in the fruits of an economy with gaudy headline numbers. Growth is unequal, and jobs are few and far between. Unemployment was the top concern for 27 percent of respondents in a recent poll. Against this backdrop, it\u2019s not difficult to understand why both domestic consumption and investment are tepid.": [],
        "The surprising partial results begin to puncture Modi\u2019s aura of invincibility, chip away at the BJP\u2019s dominance, and breathe new life into Congress. The BJP still casts a large shadow over Indian politics, but it lacks a policy mandate.": [],
        "Despite the skittish reaction from equity markets, a governing coalition could lead to a sustained period of strong economic growth, like in the 1990s and 2000s. Additional consultation, while perhaps slowing reforms, promises to strengthen the health of India\u2019s democracy.": [],

Consider the unabashed implementation of the hardline Hindutva agenda in Modi\u2019s second term\u2014from the revocation of the special status of Kashmir in August 2019, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that excluded Muslims, to the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya this week.

The climate corollary is that, while India\u2019s international stance on climate change is popular, the BJP\u2019s approach at the local level has been less effective (notwithstanding the borderless nature of most pollution). Constituents do not seem to be able to connect the dots on how BJP climate policies benefit them. The air is still polluted, clean water remains scarce, heat is reaching unlivable levels, and climate catastrophes keep occurring. To shore up his party, Modi likely will start connecting these dots by promoting new, farmer-friendly alternatives to burning crop residues, doing more on water recycling and floodwater detention/retention, and making lower-carbon cooking fuels more accessible.
